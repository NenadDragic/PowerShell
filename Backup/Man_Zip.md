# WinZip Compression of a Single Directory with PowerShell

This PowerShell script performs compression on a single directory using WinZip by specifying the file path to WinZip's executable and the directory to be compressed. After the compression operation, the script performs a "ping" command to cause a delay, which could be used to prevent overloading the system resources or to provide a pause before executing additional operations.

The script works with the following commands:
* `Start-Process`: Starts a WinZip process for file compression.
* `ping localhost -n 240`: Adds a delay after the compression process.

## Code

```powershell
Start-Process -FilePath "c:\Program Files\WinZip\WZZIP.EXE" -ArgumentList "-sPASS -el -ycAES256 -r -P -whs -Jhrs ""c:\UnZipFromN\file.zipx"" ""c:\UnZipFromN\file\""*.*"
ping localhost -n 240


Notes:
- The `-sPASS` flag specifies the password for the compressed files. Please replace `PASS` with your desired password.
- The `-el` flag specifies that only the last file of a multi-part Zip file will have an extension.
- The `-ycAES256` flag specifies the encryption method (AES256 in this case).
- The `-r` flag enables recursive operation (include all subdirectories).
- The `-P` flag preserves the path information.
- The `-whs` flag hides the subdirectory information.
- The `-Jhrs` flag removes the file attributes before adding them to the archive.
