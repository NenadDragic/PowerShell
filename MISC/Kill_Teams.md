# PowerShell Script to Kill all Teams.exe Processes

This script uses PowerShell's `Get-Process` and `Stop-Process` cmdlets to identify and kill all instances of Microsoft Teams (`Teams.exe`) running on your system.

```powershell
Get-Process -Name Teams -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Stop-Process -Force
```

## How it Works

1. `Get-Process -Name Teams -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue` - This command will get all the processes with the name "Teams". The `-ErrorAction SilentlyContinue` parameter is used to suppress any error message in case there is no process with the name "Teams" currently running.

2. `| Stop-Process -Force` - The pipe (`|`) is used to pass the output of the `Get-Process` command (all the "Teams" processes) to the `Stop-Process` command. `Stop-Process` is responsible for terminating the process. The `-Force` parameter is used to forcibly kill the process without asking for user confirmation.

## Important Note
Please be aware that this script will close all instances of Microsoft Teams that are currently running on your system. Any unsaved work will be lost. Be sure to save your work and inform other users (if any) before running this script. You might also need administrative privileges to kill processes in some cases.
